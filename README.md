## Hello World ðŸ‘‹


> I'm Jean Luc Abayo (from ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¼ Kigali) , Software Artist.


Iâ€™m a senior fullstack engineer with 9+ years of hands-on experience building scalable, user-focused software: from mobile apps that support farmers to backend systems that power traceability in supply chains.

Currently contributing to engineering efforts at [One Acre Fund](https://github.com/one-acre-fund/), where I enjoy the combination of product thinking and technical execution. I value simplicity, ownership, and building things that work.

Beyond code, Iâ€™m curious about ideas and real-world. I lean more into:
- Philosophy and psychology books
- Tech and science discussion 
- Current exploring side projects in construction and agriculture
- Sci-Fi Movies, gaming, or working out

## Key Interests:
- [x] Scalable software architecture
- [x] DevOps & CI/CD automation
- [x] Go,Typescript, React Native, Kotlin, Ruby, PostgreSQL
- [x] Building tech for social impact
- [x] Philosophy, psychology & sci-fi

```Good code is like a good joke â€” it needs no explanation: write simple clean code, lead with purpose, and stay grounded.```
