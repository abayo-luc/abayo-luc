## Hello World ðŸ‘‹


> I'm Jean Luc Abayo (from ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¼ Kigali) , Software Artist.


Iâ€™m a senior fullstack engineer with 8+ years of hands-on experience building scalable, user-focused software: from mobile apps that support farmers to backend systems that power traceability in supply chains. My journey started out of curiosity, just messing around on FreeCodeCamp back in 2016. One thing led to another, and now herw we are, building real solutions and trying to make an impact.

Currently contributing to engineering efforts at One Acre Fund, where I enjoy the combination of product thinking and technical execution. I value simplicity, ownership, and building things that work.

Beyond code, Iâ€™m driven by a bigger mission: to build tools that solve real problems, empower communities, and grow into a leader who doesnâ€™t just manage but inspires.

## Key Interests:
- [x] Scalable software architecture
