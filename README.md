## Hello World 👋


> I'm Jean Luc Abayo (from 🇷🇼 Kigali) , Software Artist.


I’m a senior fullstack engineer with 8+ years of hands-on experience building scalable, user-focused software—from mobile apps that support farmers to backend systems that power traceability in supply chains. My journey started in a coding bootcamp and grew into a career built on clean code, practical solutions, and leading with impact.

Currently contributing to engineering efforts at One Acre Fund, I thrive at the intersection of product thinking and technical execution. I value simplicity, ownership, and purpose—whether I’m optimizing CI pipelines, architecting APIs, or mentoring junior devs.

Beyond code, I’m driven by a bigger mission: to build tools that solve real problems, empower my community, and grow into a leader who doesn’t just manage but inspires.

Key Interests:
• Scalable software architecture
• DevOps & CI/CD automation
• Firebase, React Native, NestJS, PostgreSQL
• Building tech for social impact
• Philosophy, psychology & sci-fi

Motto: “Write clean code. Lead with purpose. Stay grounded.”
