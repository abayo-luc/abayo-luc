## Hello World 👋


> I'm Jean Luc Abayo (from 🇷🇼 Kigali) , Software Artist.


I’m a senior fullstack engineer with 8+ years of hands-on experience building scalable, user-focused software—from mobile apps that support farmers to backend systems that power traceability in supply chains. My journey started in a coding bootcamp and grew into a career built on clean code, practical solutions, and leading with impact.

Currently contributing to engineering efforts at One Acre Fund, I thrive at the intersection of product thinking and technical execution. I value simplicity, ownership, and purpose—whether I’m optimizing CI pipelines, architecting APIs, or mentoring junior devs.

Beyond code, I’m driven by a bigger mission: to build tools that solve real problems, empower my community, and grow into a leader who doesn’t just manage but inspires.

## Key Interests:
- [x] Scalable software architecture
- [x] DevOps & CI/CD automation
- [x] Firebase, React Native, NestJS, PostgreSQL
- [x] Building tech for social impact
- [x] Philosophy, psychology & sci-fi

“Write simple clean code, lead with purpose, and stay grounded.”
